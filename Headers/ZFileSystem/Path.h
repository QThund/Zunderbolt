/// Paths can reference to either a file or a directory. This class follows the common rule of considering that paths that have a trailing slash reference to directories.<br/>
/// Paths can be either relative or absolute. Absolute paths reference to a location specifying all the directories from the root to the desired place; they are univocal. Relative
/// paths reference to a location that depends on a base path (which is any absolute path); for this purpose, two special segments are used: "." and "..". The former means "the
/// current directory" whereas the second means "the parent directory". Paths that start with either a slash ("/") or a drive (e.g. "x:/") are considered as absolute.<br/>
