/// Represents a stream of data stored in a device managed by a file system.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// It keeps an internal pointer to a position of the stream, which allows reading or writing a group of bytes from there forward.<br/>
/// The internal pointer can be moved back and forth as necessary, and it will be moved automatically after every read / write operation.<br/>
/// Streams grow as more memory is required to store the incoming bytes.<br/>
/// With the aim of reducing as much as possible the number of read/write operations performed in secondary memory, which is terribly slow in relative terms,
/// this class stores an internal read/write buffer. When reading, the file is accessed only when the content is not already in the buffer; when writing,
/// the content is stored in the buffer until Flush is called, sending the entire content of the buffer to the file. This implies that it is possible to
/// write and read many times the same contiguous block of bytes without a big performance hit.<br/>
/// The Flush method will not be called internally unless the position pointer is set to a non-contiguous place in the stream; for example, if the buffer contains 
/// bytes from position 5 to 10, writing or reading at position 11 will just extend the buffer; however, doing the same at either position 4 or 12 will produce a call 
/// to Flush before the read or write operation takes place.<br/>
/// The range of positions this class can point to is limited by machine's address space. When compiling for 32-bits systems, only files whose size is 4 GB or less can be operated;
/// 64-bits compilations allow up to 16 EB.<br/>
/// A file stream can be reutilized after it is closed, to operate with either the same file or another one.
